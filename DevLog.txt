- Got the player graphic in the environment.
But the NavMeshAgent isn't jumping with the rest of the player, not sure if thats intentional.
The animations only work when the NavMeshAgent is intersecting with something, which is only
happening when it intersects with the enemy?
- got rid of the navmeshagent. that fixed the sticking issue. but now its an issue of velocity
it only sees the y velocity change when moving, so it starts to animate when you jump but thats it.
- AHA!
   - getting rid of navmeshagent fixed issue with jump
   - playermotor had to edit its own velocity.x parameters
- new goal: have the awsd buttons modify velocity in a pleasing way


2.3.20:
- trying to add the jump animation. sorta had it working with an extra animation GetComponent
but trying to add it through the animationcontroller. having the same issue where right falls through t
the floor. Because didn't have avatar --> had to put the Rig type of the prefab back to Humanoid (it'd
been LEgacy to use the simple animation controller)
- got that to fix falling issue. currently walking fine, but getting the animation controller to
jump is tricky. after that we should have all basic motions set and can work on tuning in Unity, and
setting up more polished Blends
- Figured it out:
    - its not a transition, but a trigger.
      https://www.studica.com/blog/unity-tutorial-animator-controllers
      - drag animation right into animator, add transitiona rrows, and add trigger (same place as parameters)
      - then animator.SetTrigger("jump")
- Now the tuning needs to happen, but it can run and jump!!

Importing a RIG:
- remove Camera in Blender
- export in fbx
- click on prefab once imported into Characters folder
- Rig > Humanoid Apply
- Motion > Root Motion
- link to animator
     - import new actions if necessary
     - wire up character animator


2.4.20
- broke up the jump anim into a jump, float, land animations and added each with triggers
    - theres a lag in transitions, so need to uncheck 'exit time' in the transition menu.
    - now it can walk and run and jump, though its very gummy right now
    - maybe first shareable game involves this player moving around their world, a mad simple one, doing somehting?
    - TODO: clean, consolodiate & commit code. Tweak and edit values of speed so running animation smooths over.
         - bake mesh properly and work out jumping minor bugs


2.6.20
- modified the speed so walking and running work, added a shift switch between two. looks pretty good
- baked mesh again after adding obstacles, and the melting into the obstacle issue went away
- TODO: add the human rig onto the enemy
- "too many characters in character literal" --> C# is sensitive to 'single quotes' vs "double quotes"
- in order to detect end of animation:
     - got to the project folder at bottom, rig, then animation (e.g. jump)
      - add an event at the bottom
      - make sure the graphic itself has an AnimationHelper to catch those events and relay to animator
